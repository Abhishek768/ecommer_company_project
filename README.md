# ecommer_company_project
 Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.  The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
In this project we work on the Linear Regression algorithm of Machine Learning.
Conclusion 
Do you think the company should focus more on their mobile app or on their website?
Ans) Develop the Website to catch up to the performance of the mobile app, 
or develop the app more since that is what is working better. 
This sort of answer really depends on the other factors going on at the company, we would probably want to explore 
the relationship between Length of Membership and the App or the Website for more lights to our conclusion.
